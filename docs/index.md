# Ancestors' Eye â€” 17th Century

*A town you can walk in an hour; courtrooms with rooms of dozens.*

This project tells 1600â€“1699 through **two theaters**â€”**Virginia** and **New Netherland / Hudson**â€”with a third corridor opening late century (**Quaker Delaware Valley**).  
Each decade page follows the same rhythm:
- **What the world sounds like** to people on the ground
- **Crowd size** (feel, not a census)
- The **local scenes**
- **Ancestor flags**
- **Documents of the decade**

ðŸ‘‰ For a print/PDF manuscript, these same pages export cleanly. On the web, footnotes pop over the text and boxes keep things skimmable.
