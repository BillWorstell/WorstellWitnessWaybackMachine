## Mini-bio: Volkert Dircks (bapt. 1643)

**Who:** Son of **Dirck Volckertszen (?de Noorman?)** and **Christina (Vigne)**; **baptized 1643** in the New Amsterdam Dutch Reformed Church.

**Where he grows up:** The **lanes of Smit?s Vly** on Manhattan?s East River and the **Noorman?s Kill** shore in Bushwick?cross-river errands define childhood and work.

**What a week may look like (1640s?1650s):**
- **Boats & yards:** fetching timber, caulking skiffs, lightering cargo at the slips.
- **Meadow chores:** haying and grazing on the Bushwick side when tides and weather allow.
- **Town life:** church, court days, and markets within a short walk of the vly.

**People around him:** Vigne/Vinhje kin; ship carpenters, ferrymen, coopers; neighbors who appear as sponsors and witnesses in DRC registers.

**Records to look for:**
- **DRC baptisms** (entry for 1643) and later marriages.
- **Court/notarial minutes** naming **Volkert Dircks/Dircksen** in bonds, testimonies, or small suits.
- **Town/land papers** in **Boswijck (Bushwick)** for meadow or path references.
