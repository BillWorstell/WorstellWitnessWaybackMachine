summary: A ship’s-carpenter family anchored at Smit’s Vly (Manhattan) with a shore plot at Noorman’s Kill/Bushwick; work and kin flow across the East River.
---

**Headline:** *Dirck Volckertszen* — called **“de Noorman”** (“the Norseman”) in New Amsterdam records — appears along the East River waterfront by the early 1640s. He and **Christina (Vigne)** make their household near **Smit’s Vly** (Smith’s Valley), a marshy cove and market edge; their son **Volkert Dircks** is baptized **1643**. The family’s work and plots likely straddle Manhattan and **the Bushwick/Greenpoint shore** (often labeled **Noorman’s/Norman’s Kill**).

!!! info "Crowd feel (their rooms of dozens)"
    - **Smit’s Vly lanes (1640s):** a few dozen households; shipwrights, ferrymen, shoemakers, tobacco planters, market women.
    - **Bushwick shore (Greenpoint inlets):** scattered farms/meadows; seasonal swings when boats and hay crews gather.
    - **Languages you’d hear:** Dutch, Low German, French, Scandinavian accents, Lenape/Munsee, some English.

## People & household

- **Dirck Volckertszen (“de Noorman”)** — ship’s carpenter / boatwright; appears frequently in court/notarial records; associated with Smit’s Vly lot(s).
- **Christina (Vigne)** — from one of the earliest Manhattan families connected to the East River fringe.
- **Volkert Dircks** — **bapt. 1643** (Dutch Reformed Church, New Amsterdam); grows up between waterfront lanes and the ferry slips.

*Kin & neighbors that recur around them:* Vigne/Vinhje relations; artisans and smallholders near the East River strand; ferrymen crossing to the Long Island shore (Bushwick/Greentown meadows).

## Work & land

- **Water work:** building/repairing small craft; lightering cargo; ferrying people and livestock; maintaining slipways.
- **Town lot at Smit’s Vly:** close enough to hear caulking mallets; convenient to markets and court sessions.
- **Shore plot at Noorman’s Kill (Bushwick):** meadow and garden ground, with boat access; a “commute” by tide and wind.

## Timeline (drop-in beats you can cite)
- **1630s–early 1640s:** Dirck present on the East River edge; Smit’s Vly lanes take shape.
- **1643:** **Volkert Dircks** baptized during the early phase of **Kieft’s War (1643–45)**; siege-y years in town.
- **Mid-1640s:** Recovery and replanting; continued boat work and cross-river traffic.
- **1650s:** Castello-Plan era; town tightening; Long Island farming nodes (Bushwick) mapped and taxed.
- **1664:** English takeover; daily life continues with new officials and paperwork.

## Where this family intersects the decade chapters

- **Orientation:** [1600s overview](/decades/1600s/) — probes & soundings leading into settlement.

## Documents to look for (and where)
- **DRC baptisms & marriages (New Amsterdam/New York)** — entries for **Volkert Dircks (1643)** and Vigne kin.
- **Court minutes & notarial records (New Netherland)** — suits, slanders, bonds, boatwork; frequent mentions of “de Noorman”.
- **Castello Plan & derivatives** — lot placement at Smit’s Vly; neighbors and lanes.
- **Bushwick/Long Island town records** — meadows, cattle marks, path orders along the Greenpoint inlets.

!!! tip "Research leads"
    - Track **lot numbers** at Smit’s Vly and correlate to the Castello Plan key.
    - Scan **notarial inventories** for tool lists (adzes, caulking irons) that signal boatwright work.
    - Follow **Vigne** witnesses/godparents to map the social web around the baptisms.
    - Long Island papers often call the creek **Noorman’s/Norman’s Kill**—search variant spellings.
