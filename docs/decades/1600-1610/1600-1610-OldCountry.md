!!! tip "What this page does"
    Puts **home-country** context beside the New World headcounts. These are the pressures and possibilities your ancestors felt in place—what made Jamestown, the Hudson, or Quebec “make sense” later.

## At-a-glance: where our people were (and why it mattered)

- **England & Wales (Midlands, Lancashire/Yorkshire, Monmouthshire, Essex)** —  
  Rural yeoman worlds with **enclosure** tensions (Midland Revolt, 1607) and pockets of **recusant** Catholicism (notably Lancashire). In **Essex**, a **Puritan** culture of long sermons and literacy readies later New England migration. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

- **Dutch Republic (Amsterdam and Holland towns)** —  
  A tolerant, booming refuge for **Huguenots/Walloons**; Amsterdam around 1600 is cosmopolitan, with a large foreign-born share and rising prosperity—fertile ground for later New Netherland links. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

- **France (Brittany/Rennes)** —  
  Early-decade **fragile peace** after the Wars of Religion; the **Edict of Nantes** is enforced in Rennes circa 1600, easing daily life for Protestants (uneasily) until Henry IV’s assassination in 1610. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

- **Switzerland & German southwest (Bernese Oberland; Palatinate borderlands)** —  
  Swiss alpine communities enjoy **stability/neutrality** while nearby German lands stand at the **calm before the storm** that will explode in 1618; this backdrop later fuels out-migration. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

## Timeline — Old World (1600–1610)

- **1600** — **Rennes** registers the Edict of Nantes; Brittany’s towns experience a tentative religious peace. Rural **Lancashire/Yorkshire** life continues in small farming villages; Catholic recusancy persists. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
- **1602** — **VOC chartered** in the Dutch Republic: a new scale of war-making, trading, and colonizing capacity that will later point toward the Hudson. *(Old-World driver of a New-World scene.)* :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}
- **1603** — **James I** accedes in England; Puritan hopes for sweeping reform cool, nudging restless congregations toward emigration in coming decades. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}
- **1606** — **Virginia Company** chartered in London—an English joint-stock experiment that will plant Jamestown the next year. *(Old-World finance → New-World colony.)* :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}
- **1607** — **Midland Revolt** against enclosures peaks; economic pressure on commoners is visible and remembered in village talk. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}
- **1608–1609** — Amsterdam’s tolerant boom continues; Huguenot/Waloon refugees integrate; **Henry Hudson** sails from a Dutch commission in 1609. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}
- **1609** — **Twelve Years’ Truce** begins (Dutch–Spanish), ushering calm and capital that benefit Dutch towns and migrants. :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}
- **1610** — **Henry IV assassinated** in France; the peace feels fragile again. In Britain, the decade closes with tensions unresolved (religion, land, livelihoods). :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}

## What life felt like (home countries, ancestor’s-eye)

### England & Wales
Villages of stone farmhouses and timber cottages; **yeomen** tending mixed husbandry; winter weaving in cottage industry. In the **Midlands**, hedges go up and commons close; in **Lancashire**, recusant households persist under watch; in **Essex**, “godly” households read, sermonize, and eye the Atlantic. :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}

### Dutch Republic
Canals, countinghouses, and congregations: **Amsterdam** as a **refuge** for skilled Protestants; a marketplace where a French/Walloon artisan or merchant can restart—and eventually look toward **New Netherland**. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}

### France (Brittany/Rennes)
A city **healing from religious war**—crafts resume, churches and Reformed “temples” coexist by law; everyone senses the truce could fray (and in 1610, it does). :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}

### Switzerland & German southwest
**Alpine pastoral** stability in Bern’s valleys; beyond the passes, **Palatinate** prosperity with an uneasy sky—normal work and worship now, catastrophe ahead. :contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}
