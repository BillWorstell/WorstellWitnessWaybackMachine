title: OLD COUNTRY ? 1600?1610
summary: European settings (England/Wales, Dutch Republic, Brittany/France, Swiss/German lands) that shaped New World stories.
---

## Where our people were (and why it mattered)

- **England & Wales** ? Yeoman villages; **enclosure** tensions (Midland Revolt, 1607); **recusancy** pockets (e.g., Lancashire); Puritan centers (e.g., Essex) that later fuel migration.
- **Dutch Republic** ? Tolerant, booming refuge for Protestants; **VOC chartered (1602)**; capital and know-how that will point toward the Hudson.
- **Brittany / Rennes** ? **Edict of Nantes** accepted (1600); a fragile peace that ends with **Henry IV?s assassination (1610)**.
- **Switzerland / German southwest** ? Alpine stability under Reformed Bern; Palatinate prosperity with storm clouds gathering before **1618**.

## Old World timeline

- **1600** ? Rennes registers the Edict of Nantes; rural England continues in small village rhythms.
- **1602** ? VOC chartered (Dutch commercial/military capacity scales up).
- **1603** ? James I accedes; Puritan hopes cool.
- **1606** ? Virginia Company chartered (Old-World finance ? New-World colony).
- **1607** ? Midland Revolt; enclosure conflicts remembered in village talk.
- **1609** ? Twelve Years? Truce (Dutch?Spanish) begins.
- **1610** ? Henry IV assassinated; peace feels fragile again.

## What life felt like (home countries)

Stone farmhouses and timber cottages; hedges going up over commons; Dutch countinghouses and canals; a Brittany city healing from war; Swiss chalets under advancing Little Ice Age glaciers; Palatinate towns prosperous but uneasy.
