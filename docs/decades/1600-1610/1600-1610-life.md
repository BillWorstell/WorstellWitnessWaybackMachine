**What life felt like (1600â€“1610)**  
- William Albert Worstellâ€™s forebears in the early 1600s lived in the north of England, in regions like
Lancashire and Yorkshire. Life in these areas around 1600 was centered on small farming villages. Families
of yeoman farmers worked the land, raising crops and livestock in a landscape of rolling hills and valleys. In
Lancashire, some villages such as Wray in the Forest of Bowland would later develop cottage industries (like
weaving and tanning) powered by local streams . In the early 17th century, one can imagine Wray as a
community of yeomanâ€™s houses and simple cottages â€“ a mix of 17th-century stone farmhouses and
humble thatched dwellings . People lived close to the land, with seasonal rhythms of plowing, sowing,
and harvest shaping their year.

- Religious and social undercurrents strongly affected daily life. Northern England retained many Catholic
recusants (people refusing to attend Anglican services) in 1600. Lancashire in particular was known as a
bastion of recusancy â€“ one official complained around that time that in â€œLancashire and those parts,
recusants stand not in fear by reason of the great multitude there is of them,â€ noting that locals even
roughed up government informers sent to catch Catholic holdouts . The official religion was Protestant
(Church of England), but in practice many country folk in remote areas continued old Catholic traditions in
secret. This religious tension contributed to an atmosphere of superstition and suspicion. Notably, in 1612
(just after our decade), Lancashire was the scene of the famous Pendle witch trials â€“ an episode where a
dozen people from rural Pendle Hill were accused of witchcraft amid a climate of fear and folklore .
These trials (resulting in ten executions) underscore how prevalent belief in magic and the Devil was in
these communities, especially when combined with the eraâ€™s religious paranoia.

- Despite such turmoil, the everyday pace of life for Worstellâ€™s ancestors would have been slow and
traditional. Villages like Thornton-in-Lonsdale (on the Yorkshire-Lancashire border) were quiet enclaves.
Families tended small herds of cattle or sheep and engaged in home-based textile work during winters.
Travel was by foot or horseback on dirt roads connecting market towns. The broader world began to
intrude in subtle ways â€“ for example, by 1600, regional markets were expanding and peddlers brought
news from London or Scotland â€“ but many northern villagers were only dimly aware of national events. One
event that did directly touch common folk was the enclosure movement. In the Midlands and extending
into parts of northern England, lords were consolidating lands and fencing off commons, which threatened
peasant livelihoods. In 1607 this anger boiled over in the Midland Revolt, when thousands of farmers pulled
down hedges to protest enclosures . (Leicester even imposed a curfew to prevent its townsmen from
joining the riots .) While Lancashire/Yorkshire were a bit removed from the focal point of these riots, the
tension over land rights was a common concern in rural England. Overall, William Albert Worstellâ€™s 17thcentury
English ancestors witnessed a world where old medieval habits were giving way â€“ slowly â€“ to
modern forces. The first decade of 1600s saw them maintain age-old farming traditions and folk beliefs,
even as religious conflicts and economic changes stirred in the background.

## Sarah Crew Williams
*Region snapshot:* Wales (Monmouthshire), Midlands/East Anglia Puritan milieu; Brittany (Rennes) post-Wars of Religion.

**What life felt like (1600â€“1610)**  
- The ancestral lines of Sarah Crew Williams trace to both Wales and England, and even to early colonial
America. Her forebearsâ€™ experiences around 1600 thus span a range of settings: from the pastoral valleys of
Monmouthshire to the towns and countryside of England (and beyond).

- On her Welsh side, Sarahâ€™s ancestors lived in Monmouthshire, Wales, near places like Tintern. Life in
early-17th-century Wales was still largely medieval in character. Peasants lived in timber or stone cottages,
spoke Welsh in daily life, and followed local customs under the oversight of the English crown (Wales had
been officially annexed by England, but many traditions persisted). In Monmouthshire, a remarkable
development around 1600 was the rise of early industry alongside agriculture. The secluded valley of the
River Angidy at Tintern housed one of the largest industrial enterprises in Wales at that time â€“ the
wireworks of Tintern. By 1600, the Tintern wireworks (water-powered mills drawing iron into wire) had
become the biggest industrial operation in Wales, employing hundreds of workers . This means some of
Sarahâ€™s Welsh kin might have witnessed an early industrial boom: the clang of forges and waterwheels
turning in an otherwise rural area. Traditional farming did continue (sheep grazing the green hills,
smallholders cultivating oats and barley), but this corner of Wales was also a birthplace of modern industry.
Such work was often dangerous and arduous â€“ men trudging to charcoal-fueled furnaces, families living in
smoky valleys â€“ yet it provided new opportunities. Culturally, Wales at this time held onto a mix of Catholic
and Protestant loyalties. Many gentry families in Monmouthshire remained secretly Catholic (records
show hundreds of recusants in the county through 1600â€“1625) , even as the official Anglican Church
tried to enforce attendance. This covert Catholic presence meant priests in hiding and Masses held in
private, a quietly defiant thread in local life much like in neighboring Lancashire. Meanwhile, most ordinary
folk conformed outwardly to Anglican worship, but their Christianity was blended with folk practices and a
strong sense of community. Storytelling, music, and oral tradition were important â€“ the Welsh bards had
diminished under Tudor rule, yet song and poetry still enlivened gatherings.

- Another branch of Sarah Crew Williamsâ€™s lineage leads to continental Europe and early colonial
migration. One ancestor, for example, was Frances (last name unknown), born about 1611 in Rennes,
Brittany (France). To place her life: Rennes in 1600 was a city adjusting to the end of Franceâ€™s Wars of
Religion. Just a decade earlier, in 1598, King Henry IV had issued the Edict of Nantes granting limited
toleration to Protestants (Huguenots) after nearly 40 years of bloody conflict. Brittany, a mostly Catholic
region, had seen its share of strife. In fact, the Parliament of Rennes initially resisted registering the Edict â€“
only in 1600 did Rennes formally accept it, under pressure from the crown . Thus in Francesâ€™s childhood,
Rennes would have been experiencing a fragile peace. The cityâ€™s Catholics and Protestants now had to
coexist by law, and for a few years France enjoyed a respite from civil war . Daily life in Rennes at this
time would reflect this patchy peace: craftsmen and merchants resumed trade, churches and Protestant
â€œtemplesâ€ operated (with Protestants worshipping just outside city walls per the Edictâ€™s terms), and royal
administrators worked to rebuild loyalty to the French state. Yet tensions lingered â€“ everyone knew the
peace was uneasy, and indeed in 1610 Henry IV was assassinated, rekindling fears. For ancestors like

- Frances, such events were formative. Notably, she later ended up in Barbados (in the 1660s), suggesting
she or her family may have left France due to renewed persecution when the toleration waned. In 1600â€“
1610, however, Brittany was relatively calm: a time of rebuilding and cautious hope that religious violence
had ended. The people of Rennes, including any of Sarahâ€™s kin there, lived modest urban lives â€“ houses of
timber and stone on winding medieval streets â€“ and they witnessed Franceâ€™s early steps toward stability and
centralized authority under Henry IV.

- Sarah Crew Williamsâ€™s English ancestors around 1600 faced their own challenges. Some were in the English
Midlands and East Anglia, regions that would fuel the Puritan migration to America. In 1600, these places
were feeling the first winds of social change. One major issue was land enclosure in the Midlands. Weâ€™ve
mentioned the Midland Revolt of 1607: in Leicestershire and neighboring counties, thousands of common
people rioted against landlords enclosing common fields . If Sarahâ€™s fore-family lived in a village affected
by enclosure, they might have lost grazing rights or seen neighbors evicted. The unrest of 1600â€“1610 â€“
angry petitions, fences torn down, even pitched battles â€“ would be part of local memory. Meanwhile, in East
Anglia (e.g. Essex), the seeds of religious migration were being sown. This area was known as a center of
Puritanism in the early 17th century, â€œa centre for Puritan belief and practiceâ€ where many future New
England colonists originated . In practical terms, that meant that in towns and villages of Essex, devout
families attended long sermons, frowned on traditional festive pastimes, and pressed for a stricter moral
code. These Puritans were still within the Church of England in 1600, but dissatisfied. By 1603, with James I
on the throne, Puritan hopes for further reform were dashed â€“ prompting some to begin contemplating
leaving England. Indeed, within a generation, figures from Essex (like Thomas Hooker or John Eliot) would
lead congregations to the New World . For now, circa 1600, Sarahâ€™s East Anglian kin might have been
yeoman farmers or tradesmen imbued with â€œgodlyâ€ zeal â€“ holding Bible study in their homes, enforcing
Sabbath observance, and educating their children to read Scripture. This culture produced literate, skilled
families, many of whom ultimately sought greater religious freedom abroad.

- By the end of our decade (1610), we see hints of what was to come for Sarah Crew Williamsâ€™s lines. Some of
her ancestors (like William Almy and Audrey Barlow of Leicestershire, or Thomas Cornell and Rebecca
Briggs of Essex) would, a couple of decades later, emigrate to America (Rhode Island) as part of the great
Puritan exodus. But in 1600â€“1610 those individuals were still young (children or teenagers in England) and
experiencing the conditions that motivated migration: economic pressure (land enclosures, limited
opportunity) and religious ideals (a desire for a purified church). Thus, through Sarahâ€™s lineage we glimpse a
microcosm of 17th-century life â€“ Welsh villages on the cusp of industrial change, French cities healing
from war, and English communities stirred by conflict and conviction.

## Adam A. Launer
*Region snapshot:* Swiss Oberland (Bern); German southwest/Palatinate (calm before Thirty Yearsâ€™ War).  
*See also:* Families â€” *(KÃ¼ster/Kuster, Bushong/Boschung, etc.)* Â· Places â€” *(Lauterbrunnen, Grindelwald, Palatinate towns)*

**What life felt like (1600â€“1610)**  

- Adam A. Launerâ€™s ancestry in the 1600s leads us into the heart of Central Europe â€“ particularly Switzerland
and the Germanic lands â€“ during one of the most tumultuous periods in European history. His forefathers
include families from the Swiss Alps as well as German immigrants who later came to America. The years
1600â€“1610 were relatively peaceful in their immediate locales, but they stood on the brink of devastating
conflict (the Thirty Yearsâ€™ War would erupt in 1618). Letâ€™s explore what life was like for them just before the
storm.

- One branch of Adamâ€™s family hails from Switzerland â€“ the Bernese Oberland. In places like Lauterbrunnen
and Grindelwald (deep valleys beneath the Alps), life around 1600 was traditional, insular, and hardy. These
Swiss ancestors were likely alpine farmers, living in wooden chalets on green mountainsides. They raised
cattle and goats, made cheese, and cut hay on steep slopes to store for winter. Communities were small and
close-knit; villages of a few hundred people were scattered in high valleys, connected to the outside mainly
by mule tracks over mountain passes. Bern (the canton ruling Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald) had
adopted the Protestant Reformed faith in the 16th century, so by 1600 the local population was staunchly
Calvinist in religion. Church attendance was mandatory and pastors preached a strict moral code. However,
unlike elsewhere in Europe, these Swiss communities enjoyed relative stability at the turn of the century.
Switzerland managed to stay neutral during the great wars of religion. In fact, the Swiss Confederacy
would remain untouched by the coming Thirty Yearsâ€™ War â€“ it â€œremained neutral in the Thirty Years Warâ€ and
thereby avoided the ruin that befell neighboring regions . This doesnâ€™t mean the Swiss were entirely at
peace (there were occasional Catholicâ€“Protestant tensions internally), but it means Adam Launerâ€™s Swiss
forebears did not see their towns burned or their fields trampled by armies, a fate so common elsewhere.
They did, however, witness many Swiss men leaving to serve as mercenary soldiers abroad â€“ a traditional
occupation for surplus young men in these areas. Those who stayed continued a pre-industrial alpine
lifestyle that had changed little in centuries. The first decade of the 1600s for them would be remembered
for good harvests or harsh winters, not political events. A notable backdrop: in 1602 the city of Bern
(leading canton) joined other Swiss in forming the Defensive Alliance to guard their neutrality, reflecting
how seriously the Swiss took staying out of othersâ€™ wars.

- Another part of Adam A. Launerâ€™s lineage includes German and Swiss-German families who would
eventually emigrate to America (in the 1700s). In 1600â€“1610, those ancestors were living in the German
territories of the Holy Roman Empire, a land on the verge of catastrophe. The Holy Roman Empire was a
patchwork of states â€“ duchies, counties, free cities â€“ and our interest is in areas like the Palatinate (Pfalz)
and southwest Germany/Alsace-Swiss borderlands, from which many 18th-century immigrants came. In
1600 these regions were prosperous: fertile farmlands along the Rhine, thriving market towns, and a
mixture of Lutheran, Reformed, and Catholic populations coexisting under the Peace of Augsburg (1555
agreement allowing princes to choose their stateâ€™s religion). For example, the Electoral Palatinate was a
Calvinist-ruled principality and one of the more modern, commercially active parts of Germany. However,
dark times were imminent. In 1618, religious and political tensions would ignite the Thirty Yearsâ€™ War
(1618â€“1648) â€“ and the Palatinate would be one of the first areas devastated. Although this is just outside
our decade, itâ€™s worth noting what lay just ahead: by 1623, invading armies had overrun the Palatinate and
â€œput as much as 50 percent of the population to deathâ€ in that territory . This gives a sense of how
brutal life would become. But in 1600â€“1610, Adamâ€™s German ancestors were likely living in a relatively
normal environment, unaware of the coming cataclysm. They lived in walled towns and villages by rivers
and vineyards. A craftsman in a Palatine town might have spent 1600 working his trade (say, a cooper
making wine barrels), attending the local Lutheran church on Sundays, and hearing rumors of trouble in
distant Prague (where a Protestant-Catholic conflict was brewing). Peasants in the countryside paid their
taxes and labored in the fields of their landlord, not knowing that armies would soon requisition their grain
and burn their barns. It was, in other words, the calm before the storm.

- One illustrative family from Adamâ€™s line is the KÃ¼ster (Kuster) family, of Swiss-German origin. Around 1600
they may have lived in regions like the Duchy of JÃ¼lich or the Swiss-German border. The Kusters were
likely Reformed (Calvinist) in faith. In the decade of 1600, that area saw religious contention as well â€“ for
instance, nearby, the city of Aachen had riots between Protestants and Catholics in 1601. The environment
was tense: the Holy Roman Empireâ€™s uneasy religious peace was fraying. Yet daily life went on â€“ people
married, children were born, crops planted and harvested. Families like the Kusters or Bushongs (originally
BÃ¼sching or Boschung in German, a name in Adamâ€™s ancestry) persevered through these challenges. Later
in the century, faced with war, famine (the winter of 1708/09 was brutally cold, destroying crops ), and
continued persecution, many from these German families decided to seek a new life in America. The
experiences around 1600â€“1610 â€“ alternating between relative prosperity and lurking instability â€“ set the
stage for that decision.

- In summary, Adam A. Launerâ€™s ancestors lived in a Europe of contrasts during 1600â€“1610. In Switzerland,
they benefited from stability and alpine self-sufficiency, insulated from Europeâ€™s conflicts. In the German
southwest, they enjoyed a last few years of normalcy before one of historyâ€™s worst wars would upend
everything. Their lives in that decade encapsulate the end of an era: the final days of the old German order
and the eve of massive social upheaval.

## Ada Arabelle Powell
*Region snapshot:* North Wales (Denbighshire borderlands); Amsterdam & Huguenot refugee communities; Dutch Golden Age onset.  
*See also:* Families â€” *(Powell, Fulkerson/Volckerszon)* Â· Places â€” [Amsterdam](../places/amsterdam.md){: .muted }

**What life felt like (1600â€“1610)**  

- Ada Arabelle Powellâ€™s lineage encompasses Welsh, English, and Dutch/French Huguenot roots, giving us
a broad view of life in 1600â€“1610 across Western Europe. Her family lines highlight the experiences of rural
Wales, Quaker precursors in England, and Protestant refugees in the Netherlands at the dawn of the
17th century.

- One prominent ancestral branch is the Powell family of Wales. The Powells trace back to Denbighshire in
North Wales, where an ancestor (possibly a Thomas Powellâ€™s father) would have been living circa 1600.
North Wales at that time was a land of ancient castles, market towns like Wrexham and Denbigh, and village
communities still steeped in Welsh language and custom. By 1600, Wales had been under English rule for
generations, but the everyday culture remained distinctly Welsh. A man of the Powell family around 1600
might have been a yeoman farmer or minor gentry in the borough of Holt (Denbighshire) â€“ Holt was a small
town near the English border. Life here revolved around agriculture: cultivating wheat or barley on the
lowlands and pasturing sheep or cattle. Homes were built of timber frame or local stone, with slate roofs
common in that region. The social structure in Wales was transitioning; the old tribal clan system had
faded, replaced by English-style land ownership, yet strong kinship bonds endured among Welsh families.
Religiously, Wales in 1600 was officially Anglican, but Catholic sympathies lingered among many families
(especially in the gentry). For instance, in nearby Monmouthshire (South Wales), recusant rolls between
1580â€“1625 counted hundreds of Catholics . In North Wales, recusancy was less documented but
undoubtedly present in pockets. Thus, the Powell ancestors may have practiced a cautious conformity â€“
attending parish church but perhaps privately holding older faith traditions. By the late 1600s, some of the
Powell descendants would embrace nonconformist religion (one Joab Powell born later became a noted
Baptist minister on the American frontier), but in 1600 this was yet to come. The first decade of the 17th
century for the Powells of Denbighshire would have been peaceful and parochial. Not far away, in 1601,
Queen Elizabethâ€™s forces put down a last rebellion in Ireland â€“ news that might have reached Welsh ears due
to geographic proximity â€“ but Wales itself saw little armed conflict then. Instead, a visitor to Holt around
1600 would note the quiet streets of a border town, a mix of English and Welsh residents, weekly markets
where farmers sold butter and wool, and perhaps local gossips talking about the new King James (who
inherited the throne in 1603).

- Ada Powellâ€™s maternal side includes the Fulkerson (Volckerszon) family, which leads us to the Dutch
Republic and the Huguenot diaspora. In the late 1500s and early 1600s, some of her ancestors were
French-speaking Protestants from the Spanish Netherlands who fled north to Holland. A key example is Jean
Hochede de la Vigne and his wife Jeanne, who lived in Valenciennes (then part of the Spanish-controlled
Netherlands, now northern France) and escaped to Amsterdam around this time. Valenciennes in the
1560s had been a hotbed of Calvinism and had revolted against Spanish Catholic rule â€“ a rebellion brutally
crushed by 1567. By 1600, Valenciennes was re-Catholicized under Spanish governance, making it hostile
territory for Protestants. Thus, families like the de la Vignes left. For them, the United Provinces (Dutch
Republic) offered a haven. In Amsterdam circa 1600, they found a remarkably tolerant and booming city.
Amsterdam was entering its Golden Age â€“ a center of global trade and one of Europeâ€™s most cosmopolitan
cities. The population of Amsterdam doubled between 1570 and 1600 to around 50,000, and fully one-third
of the residents were foreign-born by 1600 . These included French Huguenots and Walloons (Frenchspeaking
Belgians) arriving as religious refugees. Amsterdam prided itself on offering vrijheid van geweten â€“
freedom of conscience â€“ to Protestants of all stripes . So while Catholicism could not be practiced openly,
Protestants from abroad could worship freely. Ancestors like Jean de la Vigne likely joined the French
Reformed church in Amsterdam and became part of the merchant or artisan class there. Imagine them
walking along Amsterdamâ€™s canals, speaking French or Dutch, engaging in commerce (perhaps Jean was a
tradesman or involved in the textile market) â€“ all while back in their hometown Valenciennes, those who
stayed behind contended with Inquisitors and Spanish soldiers. Amsterdam in 1600â€“1610 was a vibrant,
urban environment: ships from all over Europe and beyond crowded its harbors, markets sold spices and
silk from Asia, and intellectual life flourished (it was common to encounter people reading new maps or
discussing trade ventures). It must have been a dramatic change for a family coming from a smaller city like
Valenciennes. Yet they adapted, and some of their descendants would later (by the mid-1600s) go even
further afield â€“ emigrating to New Amsterdam (New York) in the Americas . In this decade, however, the
focus was on resettlement and opportunity. The Dutch Republicâ€™s relative freedom and prosperity were a
beacon: a contemporary noted that Amsterdam had become â€œa refuge for Protestants of varying kinds,
including French Huguenots,â€ where skilled refugees were welcomed as valuable members of society.

- Additionally, through the Fulkerson line, Ada Powell had ancestors in the Netherlands who were ethnic
Dutch, such as Cornelis Langelaan in South Holland. Daily life for native Dutch families in 1600 was
comfortable by 17th-century standards. The Dutch were leaders in agriculture (employing advanced
techniques on reclaimed polder lands) and in commerce. A Dutch burgherâ€™s household circa 1600 would be
well-furnished for the time: perhaps windows with glass, a cabinet of Chinese porcelain or books, and a diet
enriched by the Baltic and colonial trade (herring, beer, rye bread, with sugar or spices occasionally).
Children learned to read and write at a higher rate than elsewhere in Europe, due to the Protestant
emphasis on Bible-reading. So, Adaâ€™s Dutch ancestors enjoyed a standard of living and personal freedom
that was relatively high for that era. By 1609, the Dutch even entered a truce with Spain, ushering in twelve
years of peace and even greater prosperity.

- Finally, Ada Arabelle Powellâ€™s English roots (likely via the York family or others) would connect to early
colonial themes. For instance, some collateral ancestors in her tree (like the Todds, Micheners, etc., from
related lines) were Quakers or Baptists who came to Pennsylvania in the late 1600s. The impulse for that
migration often stemmed from conditions around 1600â€“1610 in England â€“ persecution of dissenters,
economic hardship, or the allure of William Pennâ€™s promise of religious freedom later. In the first decade of
the 1600s, those ancestors â€“ still in England â€“ would have been ordinary folk in villages or towns,
experiencing the reign of James I. This was the time of Jamestownâ€™s founding (1607), so the idea of
English colonies was just beginning. Itâ€™s possible that the Powell-York ancestral circles heard news of these
endeavors. Perhaps an adventurous young man in the family joined the Virginia Company as a laborer or a
soldier â€“ or more likely, they waited until the more inviting prospect of Pennsylvania arose in the 1680s.

- In sum, Ada Arabelle Powellâ€™s ancestors during 1600â€“1610 lived in a world of rich contrasts. Some were in
rural North Wales, keeping ancient traditions alive under a veneer of English rule. Others were refugees
and reborn citizens in Amsterdam, part of a forward-looking, tolerant society that was shaping modern
capitalism. Through them, we see the resilience and adaptability of families in the 17th century: whether
persisting in their ancestral homeland or seeking new horizons for faith and survival. Each thread of her
lineage â€“ Welsh farmer, Dutch burgher, French Huguenot â€“ contributes a chapter to the
