summary: A deep-dive ancestor?s-eye essay on Jamestown?s first years.
---

## The wider world
England tries joint-stock colonization; three small ships probe the Chesapeake. Spain guards the Bahama Channel; France edges into the St. Lawrence.

## Who is already here
Inside **Tsenacommacah** (Powhatan paramount chiefdom), c. **14?21k** people live in palisaded towns and dispersed hamlets. Measured against that, Jamestown is a pinprick.

## The colony, by the numbers
- **May 1607** ? ~104 settlers; triangular fort; sickness and skirmishes.  
- **Jan 1608** ? ~**38** of the original alive to greet the First Supply.  
- **1608** ? First & Second Supplies net ~100?120 arrivals; a catastrophic fire; chronic shortages.  
- **Winter 1609?1610** ? **Starving Time** (?80% mortality).  
- **May 1610** ? ~**60** survivors; Sea Venture castaways arrive with relief.  
- **June 1610** ? Abandonment ordered? then **reversed** when Lord De La Warr arrives at the river?s mouth.

## A week in their boots (what it felt like)
Brackish water; fevers; rotating watches; maize diplomacy with Powhatan towns larger and healthier than the fort; survival depends on trade and forbearance.

## People to name in this chapter
- **Powhatan** (Wahunsenacawh) & **Opechancanough**  
- **John Smith**, **George Percy** (grim diarist of the early years)  
- **Thomas Gates**, **Christopher Newport**, **Lord De La Warr**  
- The teenager known as **?Jane?**?forensic evidence of extremity during the Starving Time.

> **Coda:** This essay pairs with **New Country** for the numbers and with **Life & Context** (Sarah Crew Williams?s line) for the personal thread of an *Ancient Planter* who survived these years.
