title: 1609 — Hudson on a river without a colony
summary: A focused ancestor’s-eye essay on the Half Moon’s voyage and the peopled estuary it enters.

## The wider world
The **VOC** hires Henry Hudson to seek a passage; ice blocks the polar try; he turns west and sounds an unfamiliar coast—changing our family’s later map.

## Who is already here
**Lenape/Munsee** on the Lower Hudson; **Wappinger** mid-river; **Mahican** north—**thousands** across dozens of villages and seasonal camps; **no** European settlement.

## One small ship arrives
A bluff-bowed flyboat, the **Halve Maen**, anchors in the bay. Gifts for furs, copper for corn, a demonstration shot, and a fatal clash in the Narrows—proof that one misread gesture can tilt parley into violence. Most encounters are transactional; within weeks, the ship departs.

## Up the river and back
Past the Palisades and Tappan Zee; canoes bring beaver and otter; late-season maize ashore; shallows near future Albany turn the ship back. They map a **trade**, not a passage.

## Headcounts that ground the scene
- **Indigenous population, Lower–Mid Hudson (c.1600):** many **thousands**.  
- **Europeans in 1609:** **one ship**, ~20 men, for a few weeks; **zero** permanent households.

> When our Dutch and Walloon families arrive in the 1620s, they step onto shores that already had names, paths, and politics.
