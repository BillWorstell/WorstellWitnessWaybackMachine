# 1609 — Hudson on the Muhheakantuck (Hudson) River

> A quick orientation to Henry Hudson’s 1609 voyage as it touches the places and people we trace in the 17th-century Dutch/English Northeast.

## Overview
In September **1609**, the *Halve Maen* (*Half Moon*) under **Henry Hudson** explored the river later named for him, anchoring in the bay and proceeding upriver past the future sites of **Manhattan** and **Albany**. The voyage confirmed European awareness of a deep waterway into the interior and accelerated Dutch interest that soon produced **Fort Nassau** (1614) and **New Netherland**.

## What happened (brief timeline)
- **Early Sept 1609** — The *Half Moon* enters the bay and begins sounding the river’s mouth.
- **Sep 11–12** — First anchorage near the southern end of Manhattan; trading and tense meetings with Lenape communities.
- **Sep 13–19** — Probes upriver; the crew records strong tides, deep channels, and excellent anchorage in multiple reaches.
- **~Sep 19–23** — Reaches the shallows above present-day Albany; determines the river is not a navigable passage to Asia.
- **Late Sep** — Returns downriver; further encounters both friendly and hostile; departs the coast.

*(Dates vary slightly by source; this is the conventional outline consistent across journals and later summaries.)*

## Why it matters for this project
- Establishes the **riverine corridor** later used by fur traders and settlers who appear in our family lines.
- Sets up **Dutch colonial administration** (trading posts → forts → towns), the framework behind many 1600s records.
- Explains why **toponyms** (place names) and **jurisdictions** in the 1600–1670 pages have a Dutch core even after English control.

## Places to keep in view (for cross-reading)
- Lower river & harbor (future **Manhattan** and **Brooklyn**).
- Mid-Hudson and upper river reaches (future **Kinderhook/Albany** corridor).

## Notes for researchers
- Expect early **trade accounts** rather than settlement registers pre-1614; parish and notarial records intensify after forts and patroonships appear.
- Look for **variant spellings** of Native nations and places; journals were translated multiple times.
- Useful keywords in archives: *Half Moon*, *Halve Maen*, *North River*, *Manhattes/Manatus*, *Mawachkontek/Muhheakantuck*.
