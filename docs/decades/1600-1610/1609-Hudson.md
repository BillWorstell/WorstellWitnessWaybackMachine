## Overview

In **1609** the _Halve Maen_ (**Half Moon**), captained by **Henry Hudson** for the VOC, sounded the mouth of the river the Dutch would call the **Noort Rivier** (North River)—later the **Hudson River**. The crew anchored off the lower bay, passed into the narrows, and explored upstream into present-day Albany reaches before returning downriver. The voyage opened a commercial and political corridor that would soon pull Dutch, English, and diverse Native communities—**Lenape** (Munsee) and **Mahican** among others—into sustained exchange and conflict.

## Why it matters for our lineages

- It marks the **opening of Dutch trade routes** that underpin settlement patterns referenced throughout the 1600s essays in this project.
- River ports explored in 1609 later frame movement to places we discuss (e.g., **Norman’s Kill** and **Smits Vly/Manhattan**).
- Names from logs and later reports appear again in records our families intersect with in the **1620s–1660s**.

## What happened (very short timeline)

- **Early Sept 1609** – _Halve Maen_ enters the Lower Bay, reconnoiters the narrows.  
- **Mid Sept** – Proceeds up the estuary past today’s Manhattan; anchorage and boat-based soundings.  
- **Late Sept** – Passage through Haverstraw/Tappan Zee; past Catskills toward today’s Albany; boats probe shallows.  
- **Early Oct** – Turns downriver; encounters with river communities include trade, hospitality, and skirmishes; exits the estuary.
