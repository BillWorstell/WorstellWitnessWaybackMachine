summary: Headcounts, scale, and timeline for Jamestown, the Hudson estuary, Quebec, and Spanish Florida.
---

## At-a-glance headcounts (feel for scale)

- **Powhatan (Tsenacommacah)**: ~14,000–21,000 people (30+ polities) along Tidewater rivers.
- **Jamestown (1607–1610)**: ~104 founders → ~38 alive (Jan 1608) → peaks near ~200 with resupplies → ~60 survive the **Starving Time** (May 1610).
- **Hudson estuary (1609)**: **0** European settlements; one ship (~20 men) for a few weeks; Indigenous population **thousands** (Lenape/Munsee, Wappinger, Mahican).
- **Quebec (1608–1610)**: a few dozen French at a fortified trading post amid powerful Native confederacies.
- **Spanish Florida (St. Augustine)**: a few hundred residents plus rotating garrison.

## Timeline (Americas)

- **1607** — Jamestown founded; a palisade among nations.
- **1608** — Champlain plants Quebec; first winter.
- **1609** — Hudson sounds the river; brief trade encounters; **no colony**.
- **1609–1610** — Jamestown Starving Time (≈80% mortality); ~60 alive by May 1610.
- **1610** — Jamestown persists by a thread; Quebec stabilizes; St. Augustine continues at small scale.

## How it felt on the ground

- **Jamestown:** brackish water, fevers, maize diplomacy, siege; dozens of survivors in a fort inside a much larger Native world.  
- **Hudson:** a ship moving through a peopled waterway—canoes, corn, beaver, a few clashes—then gone.  
- **Quebec:** a battery and storehouse whose real lifeline is alliance.  
- **St. Augustine:** soldierly, steady, never populous.
