## At-a-glance headcounts (feel for scale)

- **Powhatan country (Tsenacommacah, coastal Virginia)** — A paramount chiefdom of 30+ tribes under Wahunsenacawh (“Powhatan”).  
  *Estimated population (1607):* **~14,000–21,000**, clustered along tidal rivers in palisaded towns. This is the human landscape Jamestown enters. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

- **Jamestown & the James River (1607–1610)** —  
  May **1607:** ~**104** English colonists.  
  **1608–1609:** resupplies add more; disease, drought, and war squeeze food.  
  **Winter 1609–1610 (“Starving Time”):** roughly **2 of 3** colonists die; ~**60** survive to May 1610, when *Sea Venture* castaways (wrecked in 1609) arrive with relief. Tiny numbers, giant memory. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- **Hudson River estuary (Lenape/Munsee homelands; no Dutch town yet)** —  
  **1609:** Henry Hudson sounds the river; brief trading encounters; **no European settlement**.  
  *Indigenous population (broader lower-Hudson/Delaware–to–Esopus belt, c.1600):* **~10,000**, in dispersed villages/seasonal camps. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

- **St. Lawrence (Quebec founded 1608)** —  
  A **few dozen** French overwinter as a fortified trading/military outpost amidst powerful Native confederacies (Algonquin, Wendat/Innu neighbors). Smaller than Jamestown but better supplied. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

- **Spanish Florida (St. Augustine)** —  
  The old hand on this coast: a **few hundred** townspeople plus rotating garrison; soldierly, steady, never populous. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Timeline — New World (1600–1610)

- **1600–1606** — Powhatan paramountcy dominates the Tidewater; St. Augustine persists as a small Spanish hinge for the Bahama Channel. **No** English/Dutch towns yet in the mid-Atlantic. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
- **1607** — Jamestown founded (~104 colonists). Jamestown is a palisade among nations, wholly dependent on riverine diplomacy and supply. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
- **1608** — Champlain plants **Quebec**; a few dozen Frenchmen winter on the St. Lawrence, embedded in Native alliances. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- **1609** — Henry **Hudson** reaches the great estuary; trading, muskets fired, no settlement. In Virginia, drought intensifies pressures. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
- **1609–1610** — **Starving Time** at Jamestown: mortality wipes out about two-thirds; ~60 survivors hold on until *Sea Venture* relief in May 1610. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
- **1610** — Jamestown persists by a thread; St. Augustine continues at a few-hundred scale; Quebec stabilizes as a fur-trade hinge. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

## How the decade felt on the ground

### Jamestown (1607–1610): a village among nations
A raw palisade, brackish water, diplomacy with a much larger Powhatan world. The English are a fragile minority amid tens of thousands of Native people; in the “Starving Time,” survival itself becomes the story. Names are intimate: **dozens alive, not hundreds**. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

### Hudson estuary (1609): a ship passes through a living landscape
Canoes alongside, quick exchanges of metal for furs, a few musket shots—then the ship is gone. The “population center” is Indigenous—**thousands across many villages**—and **zero** Europeans stay. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

### Quebec (1608–1610): a small battery in a diplomatic sea
A storehouse and guns under Champlain; winter mortality a risk; alliances as vital as ships from France. **A few dozen French** rely on Native partners for survival and trade. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

### St. Augustine (c.1600–1610): small, soldierly, steady
An older town of **hundreds**, garrison rolls and mission circuits setting the rhythm; a quiet but durable Spanish hinge on the Atlantic. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
