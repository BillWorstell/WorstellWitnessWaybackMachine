title: 1614–1618 — Fort Nassau on the Upper Hudson
summary: A tiny Dutch trade house signals claims in the valley; Indigenous nations still set the terms.

## The wider world
Dutch merchants, operating under a short monopoly (**New Netherland Company**), send seasonal ships to the Hudson after Hudson’s 1609 voyage. In late 1613, Adriaen **Block** winters at Manhattan, building the *Onrust* and charting the coast.

## Who is already here
**Lenape/Munsee** on the lower river; **Wappinger** mid-river; **Mahican** north; **Mohawk** to the west—**thousands** across villages and seasonal camps. Europeans are crews that come and go.

## The post itself
**Fort Nassau** rises near present Albany (Castle Island) in **1614**: a small house and palisade, **~10–12 men** at a time, trading copper and cloth for pelts. It floods and is abandoned by **1618**. Trade continues seasonally; **no colony** is planted yet.

## Headcounts & scale
- Indigenous population (Lower–Mid Hudson): **many thousands**.  
- Europeans in the 1610s: **one or two ships a year**; at most a dozen traders at a time.

## What it felt like
Canoes glide to the shallows with beaver and otter; kettles and knives change hands; an arquebus thunders once to impress or to warn. By spring the river is quiet again—the Dutch have sailed, and your village still names the bends.
