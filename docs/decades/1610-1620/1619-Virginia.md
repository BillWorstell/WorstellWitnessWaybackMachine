## The wider world
After near-collapse in 1610, Virginia stabilizes under stricter discipline, then discovers profit in **tobacco**. By 1619, reformers in the Virginia Company pivot from garrison to settlement.

## Who is already here
Inside **Tsenacommacah** (Powhatan paramount chiefdom), tens of thousands live in 30+ polities along Tidewater rivers. English headcounts still measure in hundreds to low thousands.

## What happens in 1619 (at a glance)
- **Self-government:** the first **General Assembly** meets at Jamestown (July/August).  
- **Land system:** **headrights** promise 50 acres per immigrant, rewarding sponsors and planters.  
- **Demography:** recruitment of marriageable **English women** accelerates (90 more arrive in 1620).  
- **Unfree labor:** a privateer sells **?20 and odd?** captive **Africans** at Point Comfort?people whose forced labor and legal status will shape Virginia?s economy and law.

## Headcounts & scale
- English Virginians: crossing the **~1,000** mark by 1619?1620 (about **1,194** in early 1620; 32 Africans recorded).  
- Powhatan: many **thousands** across dozens of towns.

## What it felt like
You ride to Jamestown past stubbled tobacco hills and new river farms. The chapel fills with burgesses, murmuring over land and law while ships rock at anchor. In the heat a handful of Angolan captives stand on a strange shore, traded from one empire?s war into another?s plantation. Babies cry in English cabins; Powhatan messengers pass quietly under the pines.
