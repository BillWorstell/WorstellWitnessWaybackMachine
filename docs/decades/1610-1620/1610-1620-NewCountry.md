---

## At-a-glance headcounts (scale you can feel)

- **Powhatan (Tsenacommacah):** **tens of thousands** (30+ polities).  
- **Virginia English:** from **~60** survivors (1610) toward **~1,200** by early 1620.  
- **Hudson estuary:** **0** European towns; **1–2** Dutch ships a year; **Fort Nassau** staffed by ~10–12 men (1614–1618).  
- **Quebec:** often **few dozen** French; survival depends on alliances.  
- **Spanish Florida (St. Augustine):** a **few hundred** residents and rotating garrison; missions reach inland peoples.

## Timeline (Americas)

- **1610–1611** — Jamestown rescued; new forts upriver (Henrico, Bermuda Hundred).  
- **1612–1614** — Tobacco export takes hold; **Peace of Pocahontas** begins.  
- **1613–1614** — Block winters at Manhattan; *Onrust* launched; **Fort Nassau** established.  
- **1616–1618** — Dutch seasonal trade continues; Fort Nassau floods/abandoned.  
- **1618–1619** — Company reforms: assembly & **headrights**; “20 and odd” Africans arrive.  
- **1620** — Virginia c. **1,194** Europeans, **32** Africans (spring); **Plymouth** founded (Dec).

## How it felt on the ground

- **Jamestown:** fewer soldiers, more planters; law, marriage, and land take root.  
- **Hudson:** a trade **circuit**, not a colony—canoes, copper, pelts, and departure.  
- **Quebec:** a warehouse and a few guns on a cliff, living by treaty and kinship.  
- **Florida:** missions and patrols; Spanish power thin on the ground.
