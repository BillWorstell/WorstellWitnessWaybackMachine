summary: A deep-dive ancestor’s-eye essay on Plymouth’s first years.
---

## The wider world
English Separatists cross the Atlantic; small ships probe Cape Cod; coastal trade and rival claims press the New England shore.

## Who is already here
Within **Wampanoag** homelands, treaty diplomacy frames early survival. Measured against that landscape of villages and fields, Plymouth begins as a work-crew more than a town.

## The colony, by the numbers
- **1620–1621** — Arrival, first winter, treaty diplomacy; a community smaller than a village.  
- **1622–1624** — More ships; planting rhythms; trading runs.  
- **1625–1627** — Land division & household plots; cattle sharing; a town identity appears.

## A week in their boots (what it felt like)
Wind-scoured fields above a small harbor; corn to learn, fish to cure, labor by season. High mortality gives way to steady routines under a working treaty.

## People to name in this chapter
- **Wampanoag** diplomats and kin brokers (by role)  
- Plymouth leaders; **servant/indentured**, **craftsman**, and **household shares** in cattle/lands  
- Document trails: passenger lists, 1623 land division, 1627 cattle lots, court orders, letters
