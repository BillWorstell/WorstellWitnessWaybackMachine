### Sarah Crew Williams line ? Chesapeake survivors become settlers
Jamestown almost quits the river in June 1610, then turns back under fresh orders and supplies. Through the 1610s tobacco resets work rhythms: clearing, hoeing, curing, guarding casks at the shallows. After years of martial rule, **1619** brings a burgesses? assembly, **headrights**, and more English women?while a ?20 and odd? Africans arrive at Point Comfort. The garrison is becoming a society; Powhatan towns around them still far outnumber the English.

### Ada Arabelle Powell line ? Walloon/Netherland crossings on the horizon
Leiden, Amsterdam, Haarlem: tolerant cities humming under the Twelve Years? Truce. Theologians argue toward the **Synod of Dort** while skippers run seasonal circuits to a river heavy with fur. **Fort Nassau** appears upriver in 1614?ten or twelve men at most, and often empty. Walloon families begin to imagine futures by water.

### Adam A. Launer line ? Swiss and Upper Rhine on the eve of war
Village time turns the mill wheel, but rumors ride the post roads: Prague?s defenestration (1618), musters in the Palatinate. The **Thirty Years? War** begins; fathers show sons how to hide grain and pack a cart in a night. Habits of thrift and readiness will matter when New World chances open.

Wool prices, hedges closing commons, ships for the Narrow Seas. Some neighbors indent to Virginia; others are transported by the courts. By 1620 a pattern is visible even from a village green: sail west, serve your years, then send for family.
