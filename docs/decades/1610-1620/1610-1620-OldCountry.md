title: OLD COUNTRY — 1610–1620
summary: European drivers that shaped New World choices: truce, reform, and the first sparks of a continental war.
---

## Where our people were (and why it mattered)

- **England & Wales** — population pressure, enclosure, courts sending some convicts and orphans overseas; Company recruiters offering land via **headrights**.  
- **Dutch Republic** — tolerant refuge; **Synod of Dort (1618–1619)**; merchants build Atlantic circuits that will soon plant New Netherland.  
- **Leiden/Amsterdam Walloons** — Huguenot/Walloon artisans weighing prospects abroad as the **Twelve Years’ Truce** nears its end (1621).  
- **Swiss / Upper Rhine** — news of **1618** in Prague starts the **Thirty Years’ War**; families hedge, save, and some drift west for work.  
- **Scotland & Ulster** — **Plantation of Ulster** settles Lowland Scots and English in confiscated Irish lands, a stepping stone to later Atlantic migration.

## Old World timeline

- **1610** — Henry IV assassinated (France); regency politics.  
- **1611–1614** — Dutch/English commerce peaks under truce; exiles worship freely in Leiden.  
- **1615** — English crown expands use of **transportation** as punishment.  
- **1618–1619** — **Defenestration of Prague** → **Thirty Years’ War**; **Synod of Dort** settles Dutch church politics.  
- **1620** — English Separatists at **Plymouth**; self-government compacts travel with them.

## What life felt like (home countries)

Stone farmhouses and hedged fields; canals and countinghouses; regimented Ulster towns; Swiss valleys stacking timber against uncertainty. The talk is of doctrine, wool prices, and war rumors—and of ships whose westbound wake might be a way out.
