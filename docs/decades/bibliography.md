**Atlantic world overview**
- Trade corridors linking the Baltic, North Sea, and Atlantic grow; Dutch commercial finance and mapping lead early.
- Religious conflict and settlement pressures shape mobility; printing spreads news and navigational know-how.

**Virginia / Chesapeake (early 1600s)**
- Jamestown stabilizes after 1610; tobacco economy and headright system pull labor and capital.
- Conflict, diplomacy, and dependence on Indigenous knowledge are constant features of survival and growth.

**New Netherland / Hudson (early 1600s)**
- 1609 reconnaissance opens a fur-trade circuit from the Hudson estuary to river valleys upriver.
- Amsterdam credit, ships, and agents anchor the trade; Fort Nassau (1614) and later Manhattan/Fort Orange organize it.
