# Massachusetts Bay, 1630 â€” Boston & the covenant town

The 1630 fleet plants a covenant society along Massachusetts Bay. **Boston** becomes a hub of town-meeting governance, gathered churches, and a village-commons economy. New towns radiate outward with lots, meadows, and woodlots; household economies mix subsistence with market exchange.

**Institutions & episodes**
- **Church & town:** church membership and voting intertwine; freeman status matters; ministers and magistrates shape policy.
- **Learning & dissent:** a college (1636) signals investment in literacy; challenges by **Roger Williams** and **Anne Hutchinson** reveal a contested civic-religious order.
- **Labor & land:** family labor predominates; servants and apprentices work inside households; fields expand through negotiated purchase, grants, and conflict.

**Documents to look for**
- Town votes, lot lists, covenants, freeman rolls; court cases; church admissions and discipline notes.
