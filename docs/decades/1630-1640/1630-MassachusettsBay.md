# Massachusetts Bay 1630 ? A great migration begins

**The fleet.**  
In 1630 eleven ships carried some 700 passengers to Massachusetts Bay. Boston, Charlestown, Roxbury, Dorchester, Watertown, and Cambridge took shape within months?each organized around a gathered church and a town covenant.

**Covenant & commonwealth.**  
Freemanship linked civil voice to church membership. Selectmen managed commons and rates; county courts tied towns together. By mid-decade the Bay exported boards, fish, and livestock to pay for imports.

**People in motion.**  
Kin networks streamed from East Anglia and the West Country. New arrivals fanned out to the **Connecticut River** towns (Hartford, Windsor, Wethersfield), and to **New Haven** (1638). **Harvard College** opened in 1636 to train ministers.

**Dissent & edges.**  
Religious and political disputes produced new settlements: **Roger Williams** left for Providence (1636); the **Antinomian** controversy crested in 1637; allied New Englanders fought the **Pequot War** the same year.
