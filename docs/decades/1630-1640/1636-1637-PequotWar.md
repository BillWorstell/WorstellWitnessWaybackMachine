# Pequot War 1636?1637 ? Contested frontiers

**Trigger & players.**  
Tensions over trade routes and tributaries on the lower Connecticut escalated after the killing of trader John Oldham (1636). English towns (Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, the new Connecticut settlements) allied with **Mohegan** and **Narragansett** opponents of the **Pequot**.

**Campaigns.**  
Winter raids gave way to the spring **Mystic** attack (May 1637), where English and allied Native forces destroyed a fortified Pequot village. Survivors fled; the conflict closed with the **Treaty of Hartford** (1638), dispersing Pequots among other nations and forbidding use of the Pequot name.

**Consequences.**  
English settlement jumped west along the Connecticut; alliances with Mohegan reshaped regional power; captives were enslaved or assigned to allied households. The war hardened boundaries between expanding English towns and Native polities, setting patterns visible for generations.
