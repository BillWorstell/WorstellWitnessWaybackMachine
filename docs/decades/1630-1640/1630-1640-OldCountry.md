# Old Country (Europe) — Drivers & timeline

### Drivers
- **Religious & political pressures in England** (Personal Rule after 1629) push ministers, merchants, and kin toward New England; debates about church order travel with them.  
- **Dutch Atlantic commerce & war** steer ships, credit, and migrants; patroon investments tie Amsterdam capital to Hudson River estates.  
- **The Thirty Years’ War** convulses continental politics and trade, indirectly touching migration flows and prices.

### Timeline, highlights
- **1630–1632:** Shifts in continental war and commerce; English dissent hardens.  
- **1633–1636:** Merchant networks funnel credit, supplies, and kin to New England and the Chesapeake.  
- **1637–1639:** Pamphlet wars and policy turns at home reverberate in the colonies; trading charters adjust in the Low Countries.
