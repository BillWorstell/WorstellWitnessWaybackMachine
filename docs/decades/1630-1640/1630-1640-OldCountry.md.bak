# Old Country � Drivers & timeline (1630�1640)

**War & credit.**  
The **Thirty Years� War** (Swedish, then French phases) keeps armies marching and taxes rising. Dutch-Spanish fighting continues in the Low Countries; Amsterdam�s merchants extend Atlantic credit despite the strain.

**England�s �Personal Rule.�**  
With Parliament dissolved (1629), Charles I governs by prerogative; Archbishop **Laud** enforces church order�pressures that help drive the **Great Migration** to New England until 1640.

**Atlantic economy.**  
Dutch seize parts of **Brazil** (1630), sugar booms, and shipping interlocks with North American timber, fish, and livestock trades.
