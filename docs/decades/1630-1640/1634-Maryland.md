# Maryland, 1634 ? A proprietary Catholic-led venture

A new **proprietary colony** opens on the Chesapeake under the Calverts. Settlers establish **St. Mary?s City** while tobacco exports and headrights drive riverine settlement. Catholic leadership coexists with a mixed population and a pragmatic politics on the ground.

**Institutions & episodes**
- **Proprietary rule:** land grants, manors, and courts under a charter distinct from Virginia?s arrangements.
- **People & labor:** indentured migration continues; enslaved Africans appear in small numbers; neighbors and kin spill across the Potomac.
- **Indigenous diplomacy:** trade and land use with Yaocomico and other nations shape the colony?s first years.

**Documents to look for**
- Grants, headright claims, probate and county court records; correspondence; shipping and customs notes.
