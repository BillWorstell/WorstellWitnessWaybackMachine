# Life & Context — 1630–1640

An ancestor’s-eye narrative for the 1630s when covenanted towns took root, tobacco boomed, Dutch patroon domains spread upriver, and New England’s first regional war redrew Native power and English settlement alike.

**Jamestown & the Chesapeake.**  
By the early 1630s Virginia had survived its starving years and was exporting tobacco by the shipload. Plantation edges pushed up creeks off the James, York, and Potomac. In **1632** a proprietary colony—**Maryland**—opened the Chesapeake’s north, creating new manors and parishes while entangling older Virginia claims.

**Plymouth to Massachusetts Bay.**  
In **1630** Governor **John Winthrop** arrived with the “Company of the Massachusetts Bay,” planting Boston, Charlestown, and surrounding towns. Congregations covenanted, men became freemen through the churches, and town meetings set rates, commons, and fences. Migration accelerated through the decade—whole kin groups arriving together—until the flow eased about 1640.

**Dutch Hudson country.**  
The West India Company sought settlement as well as trade: **patroonships** like **Rensselaerswyck** took shape near Fort Orange; tenant farmers and factor houses dotted the river. Manhattan’s waterfront thickened with warehouses, mills, and taverns serving a polyglot harbor—Dutch, French-speaking Walloons, Africans, and English.

**Native homelands under strain.**  
Wampanoag and Narragansett watched English towns multiply around Massachusetts Bay. Along the lower Connecticut, **Pequot** diplomacy and tribute networks came under pressure; raids and reprisals in **1636** spiraled into the **Pequot War** (1636–1637), ending with the Treaty of Hartford and dispersal of surviving Pequots to other nations.

**Households & work.**  
Families mixed subsistence fields with market crops; in New England, cattle and timber paid town debts, and in Virginia, tobacco dictated seasons. Women’s networks—churching, midwifery, household barter—quietly sustained the move from scattered circuits to stable settlements.

**Wider world.**  
The **Thirty Years’ War** raged in Europe; Amsterdam’s merchants financed risk across the Atlantic; Charles I’s **Personal Rule** and Archbishop Laud’s reforms pushed dissenters outward. All of it shows up locally—in new surnames at town meetings, in Dutch factor accounts upriver, and in Maryland patents signed in London chambers.
