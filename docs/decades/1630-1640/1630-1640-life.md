    Skim the decadeâ€™s big picture here, then click through to **Massachusetts Bay (1630)** and **Maryland (1634)** for deep dives. Sources live in the **Bibliography** and approach notes in **Methods & Data**.

### Family lines, 1630â€“1640
- **In New England**, kin networks cross the North Sea into Boston and its ring of towns. Church covenants, town commons, and compact settlement shape daily life; land is apportioned in lots, but families also work out seasonal exchanges with Indigenous neighbors.
- **In the Chesapeake**, tobacco profits tempt renewed migration; indenture, headrights, and private plantations spread along tidal rivers. Marylandâ€™s 1634 founding introduces a proprietary model alongside Virginia.
- **Around the Hudson**, Dutch patroon estates and free traders push inland while Manhattan grows more town-like; Algonquian nations still power the fur economy.
- **Across the continent**, Indigenous polities set the terms: diplomacy, wampum exchange, seasonal subsistence, and war recalibrate the balance of power.

### What life felt like (1630â€“1640)
- Town meetings, covenants, fast days, and militia musters punctuate the year.  
- Dispersed farmsteads in the Chesapeake; compact towns in New England; trading posts along the Hudson.  
- Mobility remains high: kin arrive, contracts end, land shifts, alliances pivot.  
- Faith and vernacular law knit communities; Atlantic prices and imperial policy tug at the edges.
