**1600–1610 — “Before there were colonies, there were nations”**

**The wider world**

Europe is still in the long shadow of religious wars and mercantile
rivalry. The Dutch consolidate a global trading machine with the **VOC
(Dutch East India Company, 1602)**—a chartered giant with powers to wage
war, make treaties, and plant colonies. Its success is the financial
wind that will later fill Dutch sails toward the Hudson.

England experiments with joint-stock colonization: the **Virginia
Company** (1606) sends its first settlers to the Chesapeake in 1607.
France, under Champlain, fixes a northern toehold by founding **Quebec
(1608)**. Spain, already a century in, holds Florida and the Southeast
through **St. Augustine (1565)** and a thin chain of missions and
garrisons. ([Encyclopedia

**Who is on the ground in 1600–1610? (headcounts you can feel)**

**Powhatan country (Tsenacommacah, coastal Virginia)**

  - A powerful **paramount chiefdom** of **30+ tribes**, led by
    Wahunsenacawh (“Powhatan”).

  - **Estimated population in 1607: \~14,000–21,000 people**, clustered
    along tidal rivers in palisaded towns. This is the demographic
    reality into which Jamestown intrudes. ([National Library of
    Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/196.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Jamestown & the James River (1607–1610)**

  - **May 1607:** \~**104** English colonists begin the fort.

  - **1608–1609 supplies** add new arrivals, but disease, drought, and
    war pinch food.

  - **Winter 1609–1610 (“Starving Time”):** roughly **two of every three
    colonists die**; **about 60** survive to May 1610, when the **Sea
    Venture** castaways (wrecked in Bermuda in 1609) arrive with relief.
    These are tiny numbers, but they dominate English memory of the
    decade. ([Historic
    Jamestowne](https://historicjamestowne.org/history/history-of-jamestown/the-starving-time/?srsltid=AfmBOorK3XkDLy1whCVbypVIQRE_G0-1qAbZ3qWRkCRyraGoQDc9TSU7&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Hudson River estuary (Lenape/Munsee homelands; *no* Dutch town yet)**

  - **1609:** **Henry Hudson**—hired by the VOC—sounds the river later
    named for him, meets local communities in the bay and up-river;
    there is **no European settlement yet**.

  - Indigenous population in the broader lower-Hudson/Delaware–to–Esopus
    belt is often put **near \~10,000 around 1600**, living in many
    small villages and seasonal camps. Think dispersed clusters, not one
    “tribe” at the river mouth.
    ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hudson?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**St. Lawrence (Wendat, Algonquin, Innu neighbors; French beachhead)**

  - **1608:** **Quebec** is founded; a few dozen French overwinter as a
    trading/military outpost among powerful Native confederacies. It is
    *smaller* than Jamestown but better supplied. ([Encyclopedia
    Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Samuel-de-Champlain?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Spanish Florida (Timucua, Guale, Apalachee provinces)**

  - **St. Augustine** is the old-timer on this coast. Early-17th-century
    town size: **on the order of a few hundred** (c. **500–600**
    mid-century; earlier decades similar scale), plus rotating
    garrison—tiny by Iberian standards, but a durable hinge for the
    Bahama Channel. ([Florida
    Museum](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/staugustine/timeline/growth-diversity/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**How this decade would have *looked and felt* to people who later
become “our” colonists**

  - **In Virginia (Jamestown):** A raw palisade, brackish water, and
    diplomacy with a **much larger** Powhatan world. The English are a
    **small, fragile minority** among tens of thousands of Native
    people; in the “Starving Time,” survival itself becomes the story.
    Numbers are intimate: dozens alive, not hundreds—names known to
    everyone. ([Historic
    Jamestowne](https://historicjamestowne.org/history/history-of-jamestown/the-starving-time/?srsltid=AfmBOorK3XkDLy1whCVbypVIQRE_G0-1qAbZ3qWRkCRyraGoQDc9TSU7&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

  - **Around today’s New York Harbor:** **No Dutch town yet.** Canoes
    and coastwise craft knit together **Lenape/Munsee** villages;
    strangers (Hudson’s crew) appear for a few weeks in 1609, trade
    metal for furs, fire a few muskets, and sail away. The “population
    center” here is Indigenous—**thousands across many villages**—not
    European.
    ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hudson?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

  - **On the St. Lawrence:** A new **French** storehouse and battery
    under Champlain, tucked into a deep Native diplomatic network. A few
    dozen Frenchmen depend on Algonquin and Wendat alliances as much as
    on ships from France. ([Encyclopedia
    Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Samuel-de-Champlain?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

  - **In Spanish Florida:** A worn but persistent town of **hundreds**,
    its rhythm set by garrison rolls and mission circuits—older than
    Jamestown or Quebec, but never populous. ([Florida
    Museum](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/staugustine/timeline/growth-diversity/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Mini-introductions for the separate essays you may want next**

1.  **“Jamestown, 1607–1610: A village among nations.”**  
    Begin with Powhatan headcounts (14–21k), list the \~104 founders and
    the toll that leaves \~60 by May 1610; describe drought, siege, and
    the **Sea Venture** link as the pivot between collapse and
    persistence. Emphasize that every English person knew every other
    one by name; that’s how small this was.
    ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powhatan?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

2.  **“Hudson’s brief visit, 1609: What New York looked like *before*
    New Netherland.”**  
    A ship’s log framing: canoes alongside, trading in the Lower Bay and
    the Narrows, then upriver. Close with the **order-of-magnitude**
    Indigenous population (\~10k across river valleys) and the complete
    absence of a European hamlet.
    ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hudson?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

3.  **“Quebec 1608: A few dozen French in a Native diplomatic sea.”**  
    Champlain’s tiny garrison and storehouse, winter mortality, and
    dependence on alliance—set against decades-old Native trade routes.
    ([Encyclopedia
    Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Samuel-de-Champlain?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

4.  **“St. Augustine at 1600 scale.”**  
    An older outpost of **hundreds**, guarding the Bahama Channel;
    small, soldierly, steady. Use garrison-based estimates to anchor the
    headcount feel. ([Florida
    Museum](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/staugustine/timeline/growth-diversity/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Why this matters for your “ancestor’s-eye” project**

When we later introduce named people (e.g., **Powell** and other
Jamestown figures; your Dutch **Volckertszen/Dircks** line arriving
decades later; **Morris/Settle** before they touch New York or New
Jersey), we’ll drop them into **scenes with believable crowd sizes**:

  - **Jamestown 1609–1610:** *dozens*, not hundreds.

  - **Hudson estuary 1609:** *thousands of Indigenous residents* in
    scattered villages; *zero* Europeans staying.

  - **Quebec 1608–1610:** *a few dozen* French.

  - **St. Augustine c.1600–1610:** *hundreds* of Spaniards and mixed
    families.
