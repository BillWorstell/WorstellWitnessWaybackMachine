**What life felt like (1600–1610)**  
- William Albert Worstell’s forebears in the early 1600s lived in the north of England, in regions like
Lancashire and Yorkshire. Life in these areas around 1600 was centered on small farming villages. Families
of yeoman farmers worked the land, raising crops and livestock in a landscape of rolling hills and valleys. In
Lancashire, some villages such as Wray in the Forest of Bowland would later develop cottage industries (like
weaving and tanning) powered by local streams . In the early 17th century, one can imagine Wray as a
community of yeoman’s houses and simple cottages – a mix of 17th-century stone farmhouses and
humble thatched dwellings . People lived close to the land, with seasonal rhythms of plowing, sowing,
and harvest shaping their year.
-Religious and social undercurrents strongly affected daily life. Northern England retained many Catholic
recusants (people refusing to attend Anglican services) in 1600. Lancashire in particular was known as a
bastion of recusancy – one official complained around that time that in “Lancashire and those parts,
recusants stand not in fear by reason of the great multitude there is of them,” noting that locals even
roughed up government informers sent to catch Catholic holdouts . The official religion was Protestant
(Church of England), but in practice many country folk in remote areas continued old Catholic traditions in
secret. This religious tension contributed to an atmosphere of superstition and suspicion. Notably, in 1612
(just after our decade), Lancashire was the scene of the famous Pendle witch trials – an episode where a
dozen people from rural Pendle Hill were accused of witchcraft amid a climate of fear and folklore .
These trials (resulting in ten executions) underscore how prevalent belief in magic and the Devil was in
these communities, especially when combined with the era’s religious paranoia.
-Despite such turmoil, the everyday pace of life for Worstell’s ancestors would have been slow and
traditional. Villages like Thornton-in-Lonsdale (on the Yorkshire-Lancashire border) were quiet enclaves.
Families tended small herds of cattle or sheep and engaged in home-based textile work during winters.
Travel was by foot or horseback on dirt roads connecting market towns. The broader world began to
intrude in subtle ways – for example, by 1600, regional markets were expanding and peddlers brought
news from London or Scotland – but many northern villagers were only dimly aware of national events. One
event that did directly touch common folk was the enclosure movement. In the Midlands and extending
into parts of northern England, lords were consolidating lands and fencing off commons, which threatened
peasant livelihoods. In 1607 this anger boiled over in the Midland Revolt, when thousands of farmers pulled
down hedges to protest enclosures . (Leicester even imposed a curfew to prevent its townsmen from
joining the riots .) While Lancashire/Yorkshire were a bit removed from the focal point of these riots, the
tension over land rights was a common concern in rural England. Overall, William Albert Worstell’s 17thcentury
English ancestors witnessed a world where old medieval habits were giving way – slowly – to
modern forces. The first decade of 1600s saw them maintain age-old farming traditions and folk beliefs,
even as religious conflicts and economic changes stirred in the background.

## Sarah Crew Williams
*Region snapshot:* Wales (Monmouthshire), Midlands/East Anglia Puritan milieu; Brittany (Rennes) post-Wars of Religion.

**What life felt like (1600–1610)**  
- The ancestral lines of Sarah Crew Williams trace to both Wales and England, and even to early colonial
America. Her forebears’ experiences around 1600 thus span a range of settings: from the pastoral valleys of
Monmouthshire to the towns and countryside of England (and beyond).

-On her Welsh side, Sarah’s ancestors lived in Monmouthshire, Wales, near places like Tintern. Life in
early-17th-century Wales was still largely medieval in character. Peasants lived in timber or stone cottages,
spoke Welsh in daily life, and followed local customs under the oversight of the English crown (Wales had
been officially annexed by England, but many traditions persisted). In Monmouthshire, a remarkable
development around 1600 was the rise of early industry alongside agriculture. The secluded valley of the
River Angidy at Tintern housed one of the largest industrial enterprises in Wales at that time – the
wireworks of Tintern. By 1600, the Tintern wireworks (water-powered mills drawing iron into wire) had
become the biggest industrial operation in Wales, employing hundreds of workers . This means some of
Sarah’s Welsh kin might have witnessed an early industrial boom: the clang of forges and waterwheels
turning in an otherwise rural area. Traditional farming did continue (sheep grazing the green hills,
smallholders cultivating oats and barley), but this corner of Wales was also a birthplace of modern industry.
Such work was often dangerous and arduous – men trudging to charcoal-fueled furnaces, families living in
smoky valleys – yet it provided new opportunities. Culturally, Wales at this time held onto a mix of Catholic
and Protestant loyalties. Many gentry families in Monmouthshire remained secretly Catholic (records
show hundreds of recusants in the county through 1600–1625) , even as the official Anglican Church
tried to enforce attendance. This covert Catholic presence meant priests in hiding and Masses held in
private, a quietly defiant thread in local life much like in neighboring Lancashire. Meanwhile, most ordinary
folk conformed outwardly to Anglican worship, but their Christianity was blended with folk practices and a
strong sense of community. Storytelling, music, and oral tradition were important – the Welsh bards had
diminished under Tudor rule, yet song and poetry still enlivened gatherings.

-Another branch of Sarah Crew Williams’s lineage leads to continental Europe and early colonial
migration. One ancestor, for example, was Frances (last name unknown), born about 1611 in Rennes,
Brittany (France). To place her life: Rennes in 1600 was a city adjusting to the end of France’s Wars of
Religion. Just a decade earlier, in 1598, King Henry IV had issued the Edict of Nantes granting limited
toleration to Protestants (Huguenots) after nearly 40 years of bloody conflict. Brittany, a mostly Catholic
region, had seen its share of strife. In fact, the Parliament of Rennes initially resisted registering the Edict –
only in 1600 did Rennes formally accept it, under pressure from the crown . Thus in Frances’s childhood,
Rennes would have been experiencing a fragile peace. The city’s Catholics and Protestants now had to
coexist by law, and for a few years France enjoyed a respite from civil war . Daily life in Rennes at this
time would reflect this patchy peace: craftsmen and merchants resumed trade, churches and Protestant
“temples” operated (with Protestants worshipping just outside city walls per the Edict’s terms), and royal
administrators worked to rebuild loyalty to the French state. Yet tensions lingered – everyone knew the
peace was uneasy, and indeed in 1610 Henry IV was assassinated, rekindling fears. For ancestors like

-Frances, such events were formative. Notably, she later ended up in Barbados (in the 1660s), suggesting
she or her family may have left France due to renewed persecution when the toleration waned. In 1600–
1610, however, Brittany was relatively calm: a time of rebuilding and cautious hope that religious violence
had ended. The people of Rennes, including any of Sarah’s kin there, lived modest urban lives – houses of
timber and stone on winding medieval streets – and they witnessed France’s early steps toward stability and
centralized authority under Henry IV.

-Sarah Crew Williams’s English ancestors around 1600 faced their own challenges. Some were in the English
Midlands and East Anglia, regions that would fuel the Puritan migration to America. In 1600, these places
were feeling the first winds of social change. One major issue was land enclosure in the Midlands. We’ve
mentioned the Midland Revolt of 1607: in Leicestershire and neighboring counties, thousands of common
people rioted against landlords enclosing common fields . If Sarah’s fore-family lived in a village affected
by enclosure, they might have lost grazing rights or seen neighbors evicted. The unrest of 1600–1610 –
angry petitions, fences torn down, even pitched battles – would be part of local memory. Meanwhile, in East
Anglia (e.g. Essex), the seeds of religious migration were being sown. This area was known as a center of
Puritanism in the early 17th century, “a centre for Puritan belief and practice” where many future New
England colonists originated . In practical terms, that meant that in towns and villages of Essex, devout
families attended long sermons, frowned on traditional festive pastimes, and pressed for a stricter moral
code. These Puritans were still within the Church of England in 1600, but dissatisfied. By 1603, with James I
on the throne, Puritan hopes for further reform were dashed – prompting some to begin contemplating
leaving England. Indeed, within a generation, figures from Essex (like Thomas Hooker or John Eliot) would
lead congregations to the New World . For now, circa 1600, Sarah’s East Anglian kin might have been
yeoman farmers or tradesmen imbued with “godly” zeal – holding Bible study in their homes, enforcing
Sabbath observance, and educating their children to read Scripture. This culture produced literate, skilled
families, many of whom ultimately sought greater religious freedom abroad.

-By the end of our decade (1610), we see hints of what was to come for Sarah Crew Williams’s lines. Some of
her ancestors (like William Almy and Audrey Barlow of Leicestershire, or Thomas Cornell and Rebecca
Briggs of Essex) would, a couple of decades later, emigrate to America (Rhode Island) as part of the great
Puritan exodus. But in 1600–1610 those individuals were still young (children or teenagers in England) and
experiencing the conditions that motivated migration: economic pressure (land enclosures, limited
opportunity) and religious ideals (a desire for a purified church). Thus, through Sarah’s lineage we glimpse a
microcosm of 17th-century life – Welsh villages on the cusp of industrial change, French cities healing
from war, and English communities stirred by conflict and conviction.
