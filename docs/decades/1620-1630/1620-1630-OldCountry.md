**What pushes & pulls**
- **Economy:** enclosure and rents in England; Dutch credit networks; French ports balancing confession and commerce.
- **Religion & law:** parish discipline, recusancy enforcement in pockets; toleration and rigor side-by-side in the Republic; French edicts unevenly kept.
- **War/peace:** **Thirty Years? War** shocks the continent; English-Dutch-French maritime rivalries simmer.

**Timeline sketch**
- **1620s:** English agrarian change; Dutch commercial ascent; French colonial continuity under alliances.

**For researchers**
- Track kin in parish/guild books; look for signatures in notarial acts (Dutch) and notations in diocesan or consistorial records (English/French).
