# New Amsterdam & Fort Orange, 1624–1626 — a Dutch foothold

**Scene:** two anchor points—**Fort Orange** upriver for beaver trade; **Manhattan** for harbor control and exchange. Fewer households than a village; mostly company men and a handful of families.

**On the ground**
- **1624:** families at mouth and upriver; trading first, farming second.
- **1625–1626:** Manhattan takes shape as a base; small fort, warehouses, mill, gardens.
- **Alliances:** diplomacy with Lenape and Mohican/Wappinger peoples shapes what’s possible.

**Ancestor flags (Hudson–Manhattan)**
- A kin may surface as **company laborer**, **free trader**, **craftsman**, or **soldier**.
- Documents: shipping lists, company payrolls, notarial records, early maps.
