# Plymouth, 1620–1627 — a town from a ship

**Scene:** a harbor townlet on a hill above fields, with a working treaty (Wampanoag–Plymouth), high mortality early, and steady learning about corn, fish, and seasonal labor.

**On the ground**
- **1620–1621:** arrival, first winter, treaty diplomacy; a community smaller than a village, more like a large work-crew.
- **1622–1624:** more ships; planting rhythms; trading runs.
- **1625–1627:** land division and household plots; cattle sharing; a town identity appears.

**Ancestor flags (Plymouth-era)**
- A family can appear as **servant/indentured**, **craftsman**, or **household share** in cattle/lands.
- Documents: passenger lists, divisions of land & cattle, court orders, and letters.

**Documents of the decade (starter set)**
- Bradford’s chronicle excerpts; 1623 land division; 1627 cattle lots; treaty notes.
