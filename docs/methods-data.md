# Methods & Data

## Population feel (not a census)
We model ?crowd size? by triangulating:
- Muster rolls & shipping logs
- Parish/meeting density
- Court throughput and ferry traffic

See `/data/population_estimates.csv` for the working table feeding the decade callouts.

## Reproducibility
- Drafts in Markdown serve both **print** and **web**.
- MkDocs renders footnotes inline; Pandoc can export to PDF with Chicago-style notes.
