## The wider world
One paragraph: geopolitical/commercial/climatic setup that makes this event possible/likely.

## Who is already here
Name Indigenous polities and approximate populations; note *absence/presence* of European settlements.

## The event (what happened)
Narrate tightly in 2?4 subsections:
- Arrival / outset
- Encounters / turning points
- Outcome / departure (if applicable)

## Headcounts and scale
- Indigenous population: **~N** (bands, villages, towns)
- European presence: **N ships / N posts / N households**
- Other metrics that make the scale legible

## What it felt like (ancestor?s-eye)
2?4 vivid sentences from the ground: sounds, work, risk, scarcity, abundance.

## People to name
Bullet list of individuals (both sides) that anchor the story.

## Why this matters for our later chapters
Tie forward to later decades (settlement, migration, law, economy).

> **Notes:** Keep tone clear, spare, vivid. Cite sources in the bibliography page, not inline.
