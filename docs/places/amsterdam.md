# Amsterdam (Dutch Republic)

**Amsterdam** was the Dutch Republic’s commercial engine in the early 1600s. Its bourse,
warehouses, shipyards, presses, and merchant credit powered ventures from the Baltic to
the Indies and the Atlantic. Key institutions:
- **VOC** (1602) for the East Indies
- **WIC** (1621) for the Atlantic, including **New Netherland**

## At a glance (17th century)
- **Economy:** Global trade; finance and credit; shipbuilding; publishing and cartography
- **People:** Cosmopolitan port—Dutch, German, Scandinavian, Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jewish
  communities, and many foreigners of trade
- **Ideas:** Religious diversity and a vigorous print culture; hubs for maps, news, and letters

## Why this place matters to our story
Amsterdam provided the **capital, ships, pilots, and maps** behind **Hudson’s 1609 voyage** and
the later **Manhattan / Fort Orange** trading posts. Many of the contacts that shaped the Hudson
corridor—and the headcounts we track in New Country pages—run through Amsterdam’s docks and countinghouses.
