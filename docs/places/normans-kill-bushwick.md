title: Noorman’s (Norman’s) Kill — Bushwick/Greenpoint Shore, Long Island
summary: The opposite bank from Smit’s Vly—meadows, inlets, and small farms reached by ferry or skiff; a working landscape that pairs with Manhattan’s East River edge.
---

**What it looked and felt like (1640s–1660s)**  
A **low, watery fringe** of creeks and inlets along the Long Island side of the East River—what later maps call **Bushwick Inlet** and the **Greenpoint** shore. Salt meadow, garden plots, and boat landings alternate with scrub and muddy flats. Skiffs cross from Manhattan to fetch hay, timber, or people; in season the shore is busier, then quiet again.

!!! info "Crowd feel"
    - **Households:** scattered farms and meadows—*dozens* by the mid-1600s, consolidating into Bushwick hamlet by late 1650s.
    - **Neighbors:** Breukelen (Brooklyn) and Amersfoort (Flatlands) to the south; Newtown/Astoria inland to the east.
    - **Traffic:** ferries and informal boat hires; livestock and hay loads; tobacco and garden produce.

## Why this shore matters here
- It’s the **counterpart** to [Smit’s Vly](/places/smits-vly/)—the **Volckertszen / Dircks** family likely kept or used ground on this side (“**Noorman’s/Norman’s Kill**”).
- A **work landscape**: haying, grazing, boat landings, charcoal and timber—exactly the errands of a shipwright’s household.

## Where on a modern map
- Around today’s **Bushwick Inlet / Greenpoint** waterfront, opposite lower Manhattan’s East River edge and near the mouth of **Newtown Creek**.
