title: Smit’s Vly (Smith’s Valley), Manhattan
summary: A low, marshy cove on the East River (near today’s Pearl St. & Maiden Lane); shipwrights, ferries, and a market edge where lanes meet the tide.
---

**What it looked and felt like (1640s–1660s)**  
A shallow **marshy hollow** at the East River edge. Houses cluster just above tideline; slipways and small wharves jut out. Carts, cattle, and hand-barrows share the lanes with sailors and market women. The **Dutch Reformed church** and court are a short walk; **ferry landings** for Long Island are nearby.

!!! info "Crowd feel"
    - **Households:** a few dozen near the cove (growing over the 1650s).
    - **Occupations:** ship carpenters, sailors, ferrymen, coopers, cordwainers, small planters, innkeepers.
    - **Soundscape:** mallets on hulls, gulls, cart wheels on planks, Low-Country dialects, Lenape place-names.

## Why Smit’s Vly matters here
- It anchors the **Volckertszen / Dircks** family story: town lot(s), boatwork, and a vantage for watching New Amsterdam grow.
- It is a **junction**: courts and markets on one side, **Bushwick/Greenpoint shore** across the water on the other — perfect for a household that lives by tide and timber.

## Locate it on modern streets
- **Approximate area:** near **Pearl Street & Maiden Lane** (later infilled and flattened).
