# Wray � Forest of Bowland (Lancashire)

A small upland village on the River Roeburn, in the **Forest of Bowland** (north Lancashire).  
In the early 1600s this was a landscape of scattered farms, hamlets, and packhorse tracks.  
Streams powering wheels and hammers supported small workshops; by later decades cottage
industries (spinning, weaving, tanning, and related trades) dotted the valleys.

## At a glance (17th century)
- **Region:** North-west England (Lancashire / Bowland fells)
- **Economy:** Yeoman farming; stock raising; later cottage industries using water power
- **Religion & society:** Mixed�Anglican conformity alongside pockets of recusancy and
  emerging dissent; kin and neighbor networks were tight knit
- **Routes out:** Apprenticeships and trade links toward Lancaster, Preston, and the Irish Sea;
  seasonal service pulled youths toward towns

## Why this place matters to our story
Families from this area supplied migrants, servants, tradesmen, and soldiers into the wider
Atlantic world. Knowledge of **rural craft skills** and **small capital** (tools, stock, credit)
made Bowland folk mobile when chances arose.
